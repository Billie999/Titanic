In this challenge, we are going to build a predictive model that answers the question: “what sorts of people were more likely to survive?” using passenger data (ie name, age, gender, socio-economic class, etc).

There are two similar datasets that include passenger information like name, age, gender, socio-economic class, etc. One dataset is titled train.csv and the other is titled test.csv.

Train.csv contains the details of a subset of the passengers on board (891 to be exact) and importantly, reveals whether they survived or not, also known as the “ground truth”.

The test.csv dataset contains similar information but does not disclose the “ground truth” for each passenger. It’s our job to predict these outcomes.

A predictive modeling machine
learning project can be broken down into 6 top-level tasks:
1. Define Problem: Investigate and characterize the problem in order to better understand
the goals of the project.
2. Analyze Data: Use descriptive statistics and visualization to better understand the data
you have available.
3. Prepare Data: Use data transforms in order to better expose the structure of the
prediction problem to modeling algorithms.
4. Evaluate Algorithms: Design a test harness to evaluate a number of standard algorithms
on the data and select the top few to investigate further.
5. Improve Results: Use algorithm tuning and ensemble methods to get the most out of
well-performing algorithms on your data.
6. Present Results: Finalize the model, make predictions and present results.
